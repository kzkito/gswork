Researchers in France have been studying possible causes of dementia, a condition in which a person experiences a severe loss of cognitive function. They investigated whether the amount of sleep a person gets in middle age plays a role in the development of the condition. Using self-reported sleep data from a large-scale lifestyle survey, the researchers looked at 8,000 participants who had been research subjects since 1985. The team found that, compared to participants who reported sleeping seven hours per night in their 50s and 60s, those who regularly got six hours of sleep or less per night were 30% more likely to develop dementia in later decades. While this finding suggests that insufficient sleep could be a contributing factor in the development of dementia, it is not conclusive. It could be that lack of sleep in middle age is actually an early symptom of dementia, rather than a cause. However, a neurologist who commented on the study thinks this is probably not the case, as the poor sleeping habits arose such a long time before any of the subjects were diagnosed with dementia. Additionally, she points out that the first biological change that leads to dementia — the buildup of certain proteins in the brain — typically does not begin that early on\\\",\\n   \\\"questions\\\": [\\n       {\\n           \\\"question_text\\\": \\\"What is one thing the researchers in France examined?\\\",\\n           \\\"options\\\": [\\\"1 Evidence that shows people with dementia sleep more.\\\", \\\"2 Various sleep disorders reported by young people.\\\", \\\"3 Lifestyle changes as a treatment for dementia.\\\", \\\"4 The sleep patterns of middle-aged people.\\\"],\\n           \\\"correct_answer\\\": \\\"4\\\",\\n           \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"第1段落前半に、フランスの研究者たちが中年期の睡眠時間が認知症の発症にどのような役割を果たすかを調査したとあります。そして、50代と60代で一晩に7時間睡眠した参加者と比べて、6時間以下の睡眠をとっていた参加者は後の年代で認知症を発症するリスクが30％高かったという結果が示されています。これに基づいて、正解は「4. 中年期の人々の睡眠パターン」です。\\\"\\n       },\\n       {\\n           \\\"question_text\\\": \\\"What does the neurologist believe?\\\",\\n           \\\"options\\\": [\\\"1 Protein buildup is not always a sign of dementia.\\\", \\\"2 Participants' sleep patterns were likely not caused by dementia.\\\", \\\"3 Better treatments for dementia will soon be developed.\\\", \\\"4 Middle-aged people generally have difficulty sleeping.\\\"],\\n           \\\"correct_answer\\\": \\\"2\\\",\\n           \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"第2段落に、ある神経学者が中年期の睡眠不足が実際には認知症の初期症状ではないと考えていると述べられています。これは、睡眠不足の習慣が認知症の診断よりもずっと前に始まっていたこと、そして認知症につながる脳内の特定のタンパク質の蓄積がそれほど早く始まることは通常ないという点に基づいています。そのため、正解は「2. 参加者の睡眠パターンはおそらく認知症によるものではない」となります。\\\"\\n       }\\n   ]\\n}\\n\"\n","  },\n","  {\n","    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n","    \"content\": \"{\\n   \\\"passage_text\\\": \\\"American Camels. Today, camels are an iconic symbol of the Middle East and North Africa. Surprisingly, however, evidence indicates that they originated in North America. Fossils suggest that the last indigenous camels in North America died out many thousands of years ago. Then, in the mid-1800s, the US government imported several dozen camels to deliver military supplies to remote areas. It was thought that the animals would be well-suited to the harsh desert climate of the southwestern United States. Indeed, initial field exercises were so successful that a high-ranking official suggested acquiring an additional thousand camels. When the American Civil War broke out shortly after the camels had been put to work, however, the plan was abandoned. Some of the camels that had been brought over were sold to private businesses such as circuses and mining operations for their value as entertainment and labor, but a few were released and continued living in the desert. Although there were several wild-camel sightings over the following decades, their numbers were too few to create a stable population, and it is thought they disappeared completely.

Every year, millions of people are bitten by venomous snakes. Although treatments known as antivenins exist, lives that could be saved are being lost due to supply problems and substandard products. In developing countries, snakebite victims who cannot afford proper treatments often receive partial doses or cheap antivenins that are ineffective for the snakes that bit them. To make matters worse, when these low-grade antivenin treatments are unsuccessful, victims turn instead to traditional healers. As a result, antivenin sales fall, causing some manufacturers to stop producing them altogether. Currently, antivenins are made by injecting snake venom into animals so that the animals produce proteins called antibodies, which are then extracted. These negate the effects of the venom. However, such products often have serious side effects. Furthermore, they have to be stored at low temperatures, meaning that victims must often travel for hours to hospitals, during which time their symptoms worsen. However, a new antivenin is being developed that may solve these problems. It is an artificial substance that does not need to be refrigerated.
